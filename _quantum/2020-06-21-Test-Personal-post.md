# This is biggest heading

This statement rules your life daily . Yours and mine. Everyone's Inherently it means how great the romulans were ? . Yeah. A city like Rome , which was the centerpoint of such a golden age in Europe wasn't built in a day. It took efforts. Decades, ages of inquisitive minds, creative hands , built it brick by brick. Something like mathematics, no I mean not solving it. Creating it. Geometry algebra and all. From scratch. To  a structure and impartable form the whole golden age.

## This is subheading

Similarly, say you want to be good at cooking. , Forget great. You just wanna make a decent **meal.  It's not like you watch a bunch of YouTube videos,** and you assume yeah sure, whenever I gotta cook, I'll just follow the instructions and voila ! 

>"Rome wasn't built in a day" this phrase has so much far reaching deep meanings only those who understand can feel.

No.That's just not happening.

Same applies to exams, interviews, writing essays for admit, SOPs , and maths for sure. Just like learning to play an instrument, or a dance move, a swim stroke literally anything.

It begins with the view that you suck. You can't even stay afloat in water, keep the tempo, solve the first problem of the exercise, or write a sentence. 
Day two. You feel you suck more.

Day three. You feel "why is everything so hard? "
...
Day 7 "arghhhh ! Damn it. "
...
Day 10. You know for sure , "uhuh I'm not a `<insert-activity>` person!" 
You stop it. Save time ? Save money right ? 

### This is a even smaller sub-subheading

No. This is where the Romans look from the skies above, and call out to "persist son! "  And maybe you hear it and last another week, still sucking. 

And another. And another. 

.. and one fine day , "ohhhh goshh. I've been so stupid ! This can be easier if I just.. "

And that's the thing about fine days. Some take days, years and even decades. And you're** depressed seeing the smarty-pants next to you who became a pro in a week !  We like **the Romans , are humans. Each unique wired differently. Surely we all have one field where we tick instantly and where we suck for ages until becoming even familiar with it. 

Bottomline. Be like the Romans. 
Stick to it daily. 
And do your bit. 
(Sincerely/honestly/...)
One fine day?...you never know.
