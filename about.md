# The lengthy story

Its inquisitive how neanderthals transformed into the modern man, and its equally inquisitive to me how I became how I am. A curious, confused adult . I am just happy to learn others are as confused as I am and hence I begin the quest of a confused life full of challenges and scary rides.

 Presently, I am student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research(IISER) , Pune. After my confused teenage years, I decided to pursue my interests in engineering (Yes, I was actually interested) . After a year, I took a massive U-turn to pursue physics at IISER in 2016. It might be surprising how chemistry was my favourite subject till 10th grade and I did not pursue CS like every million dollar salary dreamer wants to nowadays. No, I'll admit I'm not foolish that I don't care about money. I believe *"Money is something you can never have enough of"* and its true, but I also believe in the famous quote much more.

 >Love what you do, do what you love.<cite> Ray Bradbury</cite>

 I've dealt with enough concerns of parents and relatives over the toiling and years of perseverance required in the academia and the fundamental fears , *"How much will you earn ?"* and even I'm scared of failures more than anything given the numerous failures in the past 2 years. Also nothing is more scary than <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=AcademicTwitter&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-hashtag-button" data-show-count="false">Tweet #AcademicTwitter</a><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> with the numerous stories of PhD dropouts and scary mentors. But I'm hopeful that I shall prevail because ...

>'Hope is a good thing, probably the best of things' <cite> Andy,The Shawshank Redemption(1994)</cite>

I read somewhere, the people we surround ourselves with, shape the life we have, and the purpose of life is to touch the lives of as many as we can, since **Life is brief , and one doesn't know time runs out** . I once wrote an answer how my brief time yet in academia changed me .

## My Interests
 My primary interest and passion is and always will be computing and technology. If that's contradictory being a physics major, I can explain. I wanted to pursue electronics engineering because while applying **thermal glue** over an Intel processor before fixing it onto the motherboard,I was always extremely inquisitive how we are overcoming Moore's law([here's an amazing video explaining it](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/silicon-innovations/moores-law-technology.html)) and making multiple core processors with higher clock speeds every year. But there exists a natural limit to what we can achieve via classical computing, transistors embedded in the processors (which act as NOT/AND/OR gates) behave weird as they approach nanoscale regime,where quantum effects are promiment. 
Now yes, I know I know, `quantum` is such a buzzword these days. From a [toaster company](https://twitter.com/AndreasAtETH/status/1234389393504378881?s=20) ( oh yes ! ) to this meme I can't get enough of. 

![Placeholder](/assets/images/about/quantumMeme.jpg)*seriously these guys need to stop.*

Quantum is everywhere. Since its so cool, why not quantum computers ? Well, that's the tough part, and I so wish it was easy as in the hollywood movies . Although quantum computers, if built (after error-correction, better SNR measurement,and using highly coherent isolated systems) are sadly not gonna be put in mobile phones and laptops. Atleast not that soon yet :blush: . But we have to build a big one first.That's my primary interest. After a hefty coursework and projects over the span of 2 years in quantum Information ,NMR,and open quantum systems, I wish to pursue an academic career building a scalable less-noisy systems.

### Other Interests

I am always interested in **experimental particle physics**. After a semester project on basic CMS data understanding, courses on Nuclear and Particle Physics as well as a **Google Summer of Code** project with CERN-CMS on designing alignment detector geometries (which did not end well :pensive:) I have a hope to pursue this equally if possible. As I devoted more time to learning quantum information, I couldn't explore the beautiful theoretical High Energy physics that has engulfed my friends in awe and wonder. I hope someday I get more time to explore.

As a child, every kid wants to be a astronaut . Well,not me . I prefered reading up on Astronautics and my dream course was to pursue Aeronautical Engineering. As a consequence I am always more excited about **Chandrayaan** launches or be it a **Falcon 9** launch. Speaking of space, here's a picture of me going to the moon .

### Hobbies

Oh they are endless. I've explored Photography since 8th grade, cultivated gardening skills over a rooftop garden, Oh I love the concept of [vertical farming.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_farming) I had a phase of Origami and I won a few school level competitions . I debated over a couple of years before hauling myself into projects and research and even won **best-speaker awards. Twice**. I love *waterpolo* , and badminton. Although I agree I'm lazy and those are occasional. Also I love cooking. That's pretty evident from my instagram feed. 

When I'm not doing any of the above, I waste time automating things using programming. Like this website. I spent 72 hours learning CSS and JavaScript and built this website on top of an existing theme in just 5 days with no sleep. Bdw, I hate sleeping .

## Why this blog
I had made 3 blogs before this. 

This blog is a personal space of my work,thoughts and opinions. Contains logs of computing difficulties I've faced while installing a software, simulating a system or any incident that has affected me. 
Hence as a **disclaimer** I promise not to be offensive, hurtful of any person's sentiments and incidents.
