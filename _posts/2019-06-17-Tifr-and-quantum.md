## What motivates me ?

Lying in my gloomy room and watching TED talks?  **NO** .

No matter how many books I read , how many profs I follow and stalk on Twitterati , I'm never gonna get enough motivation until I see it. In the sense, its the people working in motion in that lab environment and machines whirring and the feeling of "work in progress" in the air is often what we need. That's why maybe work from home never works. If I'm sitting on the gloomy bed on the home computer I'll never work I'll just sulk .

That's why maybe home and office are two different places for everyone. There's workplace , workplace ethics, rules, dress, code , and how you behave with your colleagues puts you on a different tone than anyone you'd behaved with if you worked from home. That lack of comfort ; exactly what's needed to work and prosper. Get the task done. 

And having a boss on your head . Oh ! That's wonderful atleast you don't become the king of your own comfort like and stop working at all. That's why maybe bosses are lazy , find comfort in their offices and often lead to terrible home lives. Just because of the comfort. How easily they can boss around and control the hands and minds of those under him. Being a good boss also is challenging since you have to be your own competition as well as be comforting and caring to those working for you . Understanding their pain and issues is the primary task for someone in that position.

### Back to topic....

So I visited the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research , just for asking for a summer experience how it feels to work in a Quantum measurement lab. I've always read about 

<font size="5">the Three Qubit types :</font>

 1. Flux
 2. Charge
 3. Phase 

So when you read about **Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics** and you get to see it happen in the lab its a different feels altogether.When you see the #dilutionRefridgerator . 
Those lithographed silicon **josephson junctions** its like how a kid feels when superman stands in front of him . Maybe I went a bit too far :P  But that's the point.

The place is amazing, big workshops , old scientists whom you've heard just names of , an amazing location at the tip of Bombay in Colaba, and the feel of having the sight of the sea beside you . Its amazing. The person I met was so cool. Too cool for a prof. He's comforting and a great host, his students are amiable and friendly and the ambience is great for you to do something new. Although all that depends on the funds and how the excitement lasts over a longer duration. 

The excitement eases out and that remains is a lot of boredom and tiredness when that "NEW" no longer feels new. Maybe that's why PhDs in the end becomes tiring. Although PhD contribution is like a **dot** in their entire lifetime. 

### The trip.
TIFR has an amazing canteen , facing sea , amazing location , no acommodation and a very small campus.  Cabs are slightly on the expensive side, no Autos but yeah  it's South Bombay. Its 25 mins from CSTM station and a pretty good weather and people. Overall its one of the best in the country in terms of facility and output. 

I'm just glad I got the chance :) Let's see how july works out there.
