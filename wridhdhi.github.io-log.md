## v.0.1

1. designed the site structure and wil be made using jekyll so, if the plugins aren't supported we need to manually push it everytime.

2. cloned the repo to /home/Documents/website/wridhdhi.github.io

3. Site structure will be bilayer:
          - the **~master~** branch will have the build **_site**_ folder' contents pushed manually.
          - the **~sources~** branch will have the jekyll project folder to be build . This should contain the gemfile and gemfile.lock
    
4. Note the **_site**_ folder has ** touch .nojekyll** file which means github pages won't render/build it by default

## v0.1.1

1. created a Collection for GSOC and C++ coding
2. Create a layout for GSOC POSTS
3. created a tar of the old site on 21:10 @27th June 2019 and copy-pasted files from themes/barber/jekyll @wridhdhi branch
4. Re-init git and then pushed to github @ sources branch
