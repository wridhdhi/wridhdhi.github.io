Primarily because I needed a log. Blog might as well be <strong>bullshit-log</strong> in my case. I learnt CS50 from edX , ended up realizing I need a lot more knowledge and have to buy a domain to publish and write anything. 
<em>Don’t like wordpress</em> cuzz sites a heavy with plugins and I hate slow loading. 
<em>Don’t like blogspot</em> cuzz it ain’t that customizable with the CSS I want.</p>

<p>Solution was to learn the whole web-front-backend-jack-of-all-web thing and publish whatever I do somewhere so this blog. Personally I ain’t writing this for anyone but me now. I needed a log of all the mini-projects and stuff I’ve done. Also writing logs on <em>ipython Jupyter-notebooks</em> became borng and hard to read ,so BLOGS ! 
  Turns out , I need references and documentation of my own projects because it turns out I forgot PERL which I learnt for my first year project. So I really need a logging system public on the web since a disaster <strong>wiped out my entire hard drive</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<p>This blog is categorized into 3 topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>#Personal - contains personal trauma, hapiness and experiences ,outlets and social media drama ofc. :D</li>
  <li>#Projects - this is serious and gonna contain things I’ve lked and worked on. This is gonna be tough since github only supports static webpages and I need a way to incorporate matlab and other scripts to show data.</li>
  <li>#Logs - this is gonna contain all the support logs and everything, from tutorials and issues I’ve faced in my coding tenure from the baby steps to major project problems and how I faced them. This is gonna be huge.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>Firstly I need a proper theme. Beginning with this shitty-simple console theme, I need a proper look and feel for the website. Working on it.</p>

<p>Right now as of today, I need to work on GSoC project that’s Dancing on my head.</p>
