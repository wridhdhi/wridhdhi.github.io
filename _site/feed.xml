&lt;p&gt;This is fake excitement. Duh. I’m writing this 3 weeks after I got accepted. But yeah this is one thing I’m genuinely happy about. I’m very very happy about this. Maybe the only positive thing that happened to me this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grades shitted. Summer applications rejected. Totally depressed college life. But this one shimmer changed everything. I was bursting with joy at the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although since its facts I’m writing, I did had to prove my worth by &lt;strong&gt;passing a task given in 4 days&lt;/strong&gt; during which I totally crashed two quizzes before my end-semester.Well that didn’t matter when Nancy broke the good news that I got accepted being a first timer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the work is exhilarating. Its with &lt;a href=&quot;https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/gsoc.html&quot;&gt;CERN-HSF&lt;/a&gt;. Whooooooo. who expected ? Although I primarily applied for this since I had a good base in programming in C and Python and I really now dont regret programming Python and data-analysis for passing time as it really helped in finishing that task in 4 days (no sleep-no eat style :wink:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that long history of programming kinda did present a gift I never expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Learnt C++ in 8th but I just never went beyond OOP.(2011)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then Java in 10th. Atleast for getting a 100 in the ICSE paper :wink: Hated it.(2013)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Python for fun in 12th.(2015)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; never left. Again in &lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Computing 101&lt;/strong&gt; . through ended up with a &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;.(2016)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then first year summer project .Rotted with &lt;strong&gt;PERL&lt;/strong&gt; and SVM. Oh wait. I actually liked PERL. It was cute and simple. Close to bash scripts.(2017)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then Data-science using &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; last semester. Arghh How much I hate R.(2019)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So over such a world-tour of programming languages I firmly got through the remaining lane with &lt;strong&gt;CS50Web&lt;/strong&gt; with HTML5,CSS,SASS,Flask,Django,JS, and then finally ended up with MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all this please curse me for making thisblog using Jekyll and Markdown :sob:. All because I don’t like WordPress Plugins and Blogger. Well it’s small but it is mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-a-blog-this-late-&quot;&gt;Why a blog this late ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well, the first 2 weeks into coding I was shocked. So Afraid. Intimidated . I hid under the bed and didn’t open my laptop. I was so afraid at the massive source code that CERN writes for their packages. I mean worst of all the source code was RAW. RAW like that RAW GREEN SOUR MANGO, and to top it all the cherry was bitter(the code had no documentation)  I literally had to understand the source code through the comments and class-descriptions. It was a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wondered everyday they will throw me away. Sack me. Tell me “&lt;em&gt;You can’t do it man “&lt;/em&gt;. I was that afraid. But my mentors are amazing ! Not just my mentors, the people who wrote this insane sources. I contacted them, and then after having that bitter source everyday, I mean I literally used to open up a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;class source code&lt;/code&gt; and stare at it doing nothing for 3 days. I got it slowly in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And by the 3rd week. I was clear. I revised C++. Turns out I was afraid since I wrote C++ so long back I wasn’t understanding newer code. Like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shared_ptr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; classes . So a bit of hitting the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;refresh button&lt;/code&gt; is all I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-&quot;&gt;and ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as of yesterday I gulped down all that bitter code in a go and I wrote lines and lines of code. It flows now…like words out of a bestseller author. Now I’m confident. Clear. I understand the code. Atleast I’m not afraid anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard. Honestly this is great task, I’m excited. And after all that realization about procrastination, I’m not really afraid of this challenge. My Mentors are great. They are always there for me .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and I have my secret weapons - &lt;strong&gt;StackExchange and VSCode&lt;/strong&gt;; BOOh ! I’m not afraid anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-thats-why-the-post-today-&quot;&gt;&lt;font align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;...and that's why the post today. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Yeayyyyyyy :open_mouth: I got through GSoC</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lets Procrastinate MORE ?</title><link href="https://wridhdhi.github.io/personal/2019/06/14/Lets_procrastinate_MORE.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lets Procrastinate MORE ?" /><published>2019-06-14T16:50:39+05:30</published><updated>2019-06-14T16:50:39+05:30</updated><id>https://wridhdhi.github.io/personal/2019/06/14/Lets_procrastinate_MORE</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wridhdhi.github.io/personal/2019/06/14/Lets_procrastinate_MORE.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;its-all&quot;&gt;Its all&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;during&quot;&gt;during&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lunch-that&quot;&gt;lunch that&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;struck-me&quot;&gt;struck me&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that I was a procrastinator.
 Why have I screwed up the past 6 semesters ? 
 Why did I go insane before exams and project deadlines and why have I procrastinated about Google Summer of Code’ coding mania or mailing the people I should , 
 why didn’t I land a good summer and not mail early last winter ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHY AM I SO AFRAID to face what I really am ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-master-procrastinator-flushed&quot;&gt;A MASTER PROCRASTINATOR. :flushed:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-what-happened-at-lunch--pensive&quot;&gt;So what happened at lunch ? :pensive:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met my doc-friend who admist all the healthcare turmoil() going on in my home state,is more stressed about her exams and finding more time to revise daily. Then I realized how less I have to do , and what do I do during rest of the time ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waste it. :pensive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bdw-a-small-detour-&quot;&gt;BDW a small &lt;font style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Detour&lt;/font&gt; ..&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hate &lt;del&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PIZZA HUT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/del&gt; now. I’m never gonna have their shit. Ever. Probably the last time was they used to have UNLIMITED FRIDAY’s and now they claim to make new bases and they have the &lt;strong&gt;99/199 daily offer&lt;/strong&gt; which is again &lt;strong&gt;foolery.&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly in the &lt;strong&gt;'’99’‘&lt;/strong&gt; category you have three shit veg pizzas - margharita , classic corn and classic tomato. Anything you add chicken and even a little more veggies like olives it becomes &lt;strong&gt;199(personal-7inch)/249(medium-10inch)&lt;/strong&gt; ; so basically no non-veg or even capsicum at 99 !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;and-no-gap-between-99-and-199--basically-anything-decent-199x2&quot;&gt;and NO GAP BETWEEN 99 and 199 ! basically anything decent =199x2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then suppose you wanna save and have a budget meal under 500 even that’s not possible. Also damn coke is 85 ! one glass !. This is me not ranting just I’m surprised how these chains do such random nonsense. By that logic Dominos is better. They have bivariant chicken at 99 ! and 7 different types. And they have large pizzas at far less prices than a average pizza-hut medium piz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-to-procrastination-&quot;&gt;BACK to procrastination …&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See this is exactly what. I detour and write three nonsense rants about shit pizza. Arghhh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back I went through anything YouTube had to offer on this. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU&quot;&gt;Tim Urban’s TED talk&lt;/a&gt;to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x7MkLDGnu8&quot;&gt;Mel Robbin’s scientific logic&lt;/a&gt; how procrastination is a breakable habit I didn’t read a single line in LifeHacker or anywhere. Then I slowly drifted to finding Jekyll Themes for my this page and then… … learning how to write emojis using markdown. Yeah like this  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:weary:&lt;/code&gt; –&amp;gt; :weary: See ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah. Atleast writing this log is letting me write the nonsense I do(have been doing) which landed me in this wholesome mess. I can’t do anything straight and instant gratification is killing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;way-to-stop-&quot;&gt;Way to stop ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mannn, I dunn knoww. I never cared. I should just start you know ? GSoC coding, two papers on superZeno effect and hell lot of lectures and simulations on IBMQ,  finishing off MITOCW Algorithms has been postponed and on due since this time past year .Ouff.   I’m tired. Maybe tomorrow ?…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;no-today&quot;&gt;NO. Today.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then write about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Its all</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mandatory Hello World!</title><link href="https://wridhdhi.github.io/personal/2019/06/13/Mandatory-Hello_World.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mandatory Hello World!" /><published>2019-06-13T13:40:39+05:30</published><updated>2019-06-13T13:40:39+05:30</updated><id>https://wridhdhi.github.io/personal/2019/06/13/Mandatory-Hello_World</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wridhdhi.github.io/personal/2019/06/13/Mandatory-Hello_World.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-another-blog--that-too-using-jekyll-and-github-pages-&quot;&gt;Why another blog ? That too using jekyll and github pages ?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hello ,World' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;//
Primarily because I needed a log. Blog might as well be &lt;strong&gt;bullshit-log&lt;/strong&gt; in my case. I learnt CS50 from edX , ended up realizing I need a lot more knowledge and have to buy a domain to publish and write anything. 
&lt;em&gt;Don’t like wordpress&lt;/em&gt; cuzz sites a heavy with plugins and I hate slow loading. 
&lt;em&gt;Don’t like blogspot&lt;/em&gt; cuzz it ain’t that customizable with the CSS I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution was to learn the whole web-front-backend-jack-of-all-web thing and publish whatever I do somewhere so this blog. Personally I ain’t writing this for anyone but me now. I needed a log of all the mini-projects and stuff I’ve done. Also writing logs on &lt;em&gt;ipython Jupyter-notebooks&lt;/em&gt; became borng and hard to read ,so BLOGS ! 
  Turns out , I need references and documentation of my own projects because it turns out I forgot PERL which I learnt for my first year project. So I really need a logging system public on the web since a disaster &lt;strong&gt;wiped out my entire hard drive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is categorized into 3 topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;#Personal - contains personal trauma, hapiness and experiences ,outlets and social media drama ofc. :D&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;#Projects - this is serious and gonna contain things I’ve lked and worked on. This is gonna be tough since github only supports static webpages and I need a way to incorporate matlab and other scripts to show data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;#Logs - this is gonna contain all the support logs and everything, from tutorials and issues I’ve faced in my coding tenure from the baby steps to major project problems and how I faced them. This is gonna be huge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly I need a proper theme. Beginning with this shitty-simple console theme, I need a proper look and feel for the website. Working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now as of today, I need to work on GSoC project that’s Dancing on my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
